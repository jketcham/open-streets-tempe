          Volunteers can choose between two shifts: Morning (9:30 AM - 12:30 PM)
          or Afternoon (12:00 PM - 3:00 PM). We ask that you arrive 15 minutes
          before your shift for check-in and a brief orientation.
        </p>
        <p>
          The 30-minute overlap between shifts ensures a smooth transition and
          allows time for shift handover. After your shift, you&apos;re free to
          enjoy the event!

        </p>

          For youth volunteer groups (ages 14-17), we require adult supervision
